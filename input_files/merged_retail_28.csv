Love, Beauty, Happiness, Peace And Joy:
Hi, I'm Colleen. Welcome to our
website
. The five words that are listed above describe the feelings and emotions which are the guiding lights for Collie Anne. So how do these emotions fit with Collie Anne? Well, as I am curating my product range I ask myself ""Do I love this piece?"" for every single item I select. I think to myself 'If I don't love this piece, how can I sell it to my customers?'
I like to know that every single piece is different and unique in its own right, and just knowing this gives me a great sense of happiness and joy as I know that whoever purchases the piece that I love, will have something really special and different and hopefully they will fall in love with it as much as I do. If our customer absolutely loves the piece they have purchased, I know that they will feel confident and beautiful whilst they are wearing it. Beauty also comes from our love of nature. Growing up on a farm in country Victoria gave me lots of opportunity to be amongst the beauty of nature.
Wherever possible I try to incorporate nature in our products either through the designs or the materials used. Many of our clothing items are made from natural fibressuch as silk, wool and linen. To me, being in nature brings peacefulness and a joy and allows the troubles of the day to drift into the distance for a while and just allow me to just 'be'. I want our customers to obtain that feeling too when they are wearing one of our jewellery or fashion pieces, or when quietly relaxing in the soft light of one of our scented candles as it's fragrance drifts about the room. I hope that you find something that you 'just love' in our little

We provide furniture removal services in Epsom
At Central Victoria Removals, we thoroughly plan your move to ensure that your move is done expertly and on time.
In the past 40 years Central Victoria Removals has steadily grown its business from a small Bendigo removals company with two trucks to a successful interstate removalists company with a mobile fleet of eight. We have grown to employ a team of qualified, experienced and accredited furniture removalists whose duties include loaders, drivers and packers.
At Central Victoria Removals our personal care and service covers all of Australia. We have a Bendigo storage facility, which offers safe and secure storage for goods for either a short or a long term.
We provide assistance with planning, specialist packing, moving day hints, timely delivery, placement of furniture and unpacking. We can also assist with specialty items such as pianos, artwork and antiques. Our moving kit is also designed to assist people with their move, providing valuable discount and no charge service vouchers from a quality range of local suppliers.
Furniture Removalists
It doesn’t matter whether you’re moving to another city or just around the corner, removals in Bendigo and district are best left to the local experts.
At Central Victoria Removals, a local move is just as important and intricate as moving interstate or overseas. The only different is that the time between departure and arrival is much shorter because of the shorter distances involved.
For our furniture removalists it doesn’t matter where you’re moving. Wherever the destination, we thoroughly plan your move to ensure that your relocation is completed expertly and on time.
Interstate Car Relocation Removalists
Part of organising your interstate move is hiring a vehicle relocation and transport removalist – having your vehicle arrive safely and on time to your new destination is as important as having your personal effects arrive safely.
We are experienced in providing car relocation to interstate destinations and have a reliable tracking system so you can keep up to date with where your vehicle may be located at any given time.
From luxury and classic vehicles to family sedans, we treat every vehicle with the same care and respect you place on what is one of your most precious assets.

Slingshot Haulage Pty Ltd was established by Leigh Dehne in 1996, however, the history of this company began many years earlier.
As a young boy growing up in the Dehne family, life was all about trucks, with his father being heavily involved in transport and life on the farm, for Leigh and his siblings. So, when he bought his first truck at the age of 19 and began doing local work, transporting wood, hay, and livestock, it seemed a natural thing to do.
Established in 1996, Slingshot Haulage Pty Ltd is a reliable transportation service for heavy goods across Australia. We are quite adept at delivering all types of heavy cargo across states and all over Australia proving our might in the trucking industry. We personalise our services as we understand that every client has a unique requirement that needs to be met. We prioritise the safety of the goods and their timely delivery.
Equipped with a fleet of 10 prime movers and a range of trailers, we are capable of transporting all kinds of goods of all kinds of sizes. Our team knows the ins and outs of heavy haulage and can work out befitting customised solutions for your requirements. Our wide and heavy-load escorts are the best means of transport for your equipment. Our round-the-clock service comes with great value for money as our rates are quite competitive. Extremely result-oriented and transparent in communication, we also offer free quotes.
Besides heavy haulage, we also provide other services. We offer equipment like forklifts, low loaders, side loaders, floats and dozers for hire to construction and excavation industries. All equipment is provided for wet-hire. We also run an Australia-wide road train service to help you move your heavy loads via road. We also provide effective storage solutions to our clients to help them store their machines, shipping containers, etc.

Empower people to improve their everyday lives through innovative healthcare solutions.
Country Care Group is a local family operated business that has been providing employment for locals for 13 years. Country Care was the first business of its type to open in Mildura. Both stores offer their local districts quality innovative products with a complete work shop service centre for backup support.
Our service technicians are available to come out to your home for repairs on many products - including scooters, power wheelchairs, lift chairs or electric beds (a standard call out fee applies). We strive to keep all parts prices and labour costs to a minimum. Our reseller network consists of privately owned and operated businesses where the owners usually work within the business providing you with the highest level of service possible. Between all businesses, there are over 80 showrooms and warehouses in various locations across Australia, and in excess of 300 delivery vehicles.

Webster-pak is a safe and simple medication pack. It sets out all the tablets and capsules that need to be taken at each particular time of the day, for each day of the week. This makes it easy to manage medication. The pharmacist takes the doctor's prescriptions and dispenses the medication into a blister pack. This pack is securely sealed so the medication is protected and there is no chance of spilling or mixing things up.

Good for complete wellbeing

Taste superior to conventionally grown food
Another benefit of organic produce is it is Australian grown and is GMO free. It is grown in a natural state which gives it more flavour.

90% faster install of renewables
Experts in off-grid power solutions
Over 30 skilled team members
Leaders in battery system install
Award-winning tech innovation
Sky Energy is a leader in solar and battery installations across Australia!
We install everything from residential to commercial and off-grid solar systems. Get in touch to see how we can help you today! Sky Energy is a renewable technology company based in Victoria, and one of Australia's largest solar and battery energy system installers.
They have been in business for over four years and employ more than 30 team members across sales, installation, and product manufacturing facilities.
As an integral part of the renewable energy sector in Australia, we at Sky Energy are proud to declare our identity as a renewable technology company rooted in the heart of Victoria. Our enterprise has soared to become one of Australia's prominent installers of solar and battery energy systems, with a flourishing history stretching for more than four years. We boast a thriving team, 30+ strong, comprising dedicated professionals across our sales, installation, and product manufacturing facilities, each bringing their unique skills to deliver clean power to Aussies of all walks.
At the core of our operations lies a vision that is both bold and essential in the face of our global ecological challenges – to lead the green energy revolution. Our resolve is to equip more Aussies, businesses, and construction projects with the autonomy that clean energy offers. By breaking down the barriers of complexity and cost, we aim to furnish our clientele with simplified pathways to renewable resources, thereby propelling the shift toward sustainability. Through our work, we envision a norm where harnessing solar and batteries for powering commercial construction becomes as standard as relying on generators or power lines.
Our flagship innovation, the SkyBox, exemplifies our commitment to renewable energy. This product empowers Australians to embrace power off the grid, displacing the hefty costs associated with fossil fuels with economical renewable alternatives. Remarkably, the SkyBox boasts an installation pace that is 90% faster than conventional methods, enabling the widespread adoption of clean energy solutions on a grand scale. The conception of such cost-saving technologies is driven by our rich background as technicians with real-world experience, rather than as lab-coated scientists hypothesizing what could be. It is this hands-on expertise that has endowed us with the insights necessary to discern what the renewable industry necessitates and what truly works in the field to save both time and cash. This same experience is what inspired the creation of the SkyBox.

They are then free to confidently make profitable personal or business decisions based on the facts and strategically direct their funds or enterprises to the most advantageous position.”
Like all business people, Phil wants to grow his business. However, he is well aware that he can only succeed in achieving this goal if he is helping to grow the interests of his clients. This idea has fostered a genuinely symbiotic relationship strategy where Win/Win outcomes with clients are not merely desirable, but mandatory.

The accounting practice commenced in 1965 when John Donegan decided to branch out on his own. Over the course of nearly 5 decades, the practice has helped thousands of clients from all walks of life with their taxation and accounting needs.
A large number of those original clients from 1965 are still being serviced by the practice as are their offspring.
