Marcus is a registered advanced member of Massage and Myotherapy Australia.
Originally training through the Australian College of Massage and Natural Therapies, he began working in Melbourne in clinics and also as a corporate Massage Therapist. Since moving to Geelong in 2007, he has further completed the study as a Myotherapist through the Gordon TAFE, and also completed his Certificate in Bowen Therapy through Bowtech - The Bowen Therapy Academy of Australia.
He achieved a Diploma in Remedial Massage Therapy from the Australian College of Massage and Natural Therapies in 2004. After working in clinics and corporate treatment environments in Melbourne, he moved to Geelong in 2007. Here he went on to further his study, completing a Bowen Therapy Certificate IV course through Bowtech in 2009, and an Advanced Diploma of Myotherapy in 2010.
Through Myotherapy, Marcus found a revelation in what could be achieved through muscle manipulation and has helped many clients with chronic pain that they had thought could not be rectified.
Issues such as:
Headaches and migraines
Neck pain and postural issues
Sciatic pain and abdominal pain
Marcus strives to help his patients find a comfortable and calming balance of stress-relief, pain management and relaxation through his knowledge of
Massage and Bowen Therapy
. Bowen Therapy is a gentle form of muscle manipulation which can assist with many underlying issues that may not seem muscle related.
Marcus is extremely passionate about helping his patients and excited by the future prospects of working as a Myotherapist. He has personally worked with many companies in the Barwon region such as CSIRO, Kaisercraft, VISY, Deakin University, Torquay College and Newtown Primary School. He enjoys helping the staff to better their well-being and promote postural awareness within the workplace.

Mind & Body In Balance Therapies has over 20 years' experience and each session is catered to your needs.
At Mind & Body In Balance Therapies, I am committed to providing high quality services at affordable rates. I am focused on enhancing your health with the help of Massage, Bowen Therapy & Neuro Training with Kinesiology.
What is Neuro Training with Kinesiology?
Kinesiology enables you to bypass your conscious mind to isolate causal factors in your subconscious - ""It lets your body do the talking"" using muscle monitoring to ask the body for feedback regarding its current state. Muscle testing allows the Kinesiologist to find the most beneficial technique via either structural, bio-chemical, emotional, electrical and spiritual processes.
Feel free to get in touch with Mind & Body In Balance Therapies. I am here to assist you.
