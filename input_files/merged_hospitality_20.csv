We understand that pets are very much part of the family. Our aim is to help you manage your pet’s health and wellness for a long and happy life together.
We are big on preventative medicine. Pets live healthier contented lives if they are free from illness and well cared for. This means keeping up to date with vaccinations, regular flea, worm, and tick control, regular dental care, appropriate nutrition, and regular health and well-being checks. We don’t want animals to have to live with chronically itchy skin, sore joints, obesity, sore teeth, chronic anxiety, or any other annoying or debilitating condition. Our aim is to identify and manage such issues for the long-term.
Our approach to illness:
When an animal gets sick, we understand it is both distressing and can cause unexpected expenses. We believe it is best for your pet and more economical in the long run to establish the correct diagnosis and provide the best treatment first time. Our core approaches to illness are the concepts of:
a problem-solving approach

Reliable and cost effective products
Established in November 1984
Network installation/internet Installation
Computer repairs
Finch Computer Services specialises in computer products - sales & service, electronic engineering design & manufacture.
Finch Computer Services was established in November 1984 and its initial business consisted primarily of selling IBM-compatible computers and electronic design work. The business was run part time until a customer base was established. The company policy was then developed to only sell brand-name quality products that offered value for money.
About Us
Since 1984, almost all products developed and manufactured have been designed to customers' specifications, with most work being carried out under non-disclosure. The Company has invested heavily in plant and equipment and now enjoys having only the highest quality development and manufacturing equipment. Most of the test equipment has traceable calibration. Having equipment on site also means that almost all stages of prototype development are carried out in the factory to maintain quality.
Our Mission
Provide Friendly And Efficient Service
Accurately Define The Client's Needs And Make Suitable Recommendations

We believe that every client deserves personalised service. We commit to you & your business in the same way we commit to our own.
Established in 1923, GMG Financial Group emerged as the pioneering accounting firm in the region. Since then, our vision has remained steadfast: to empower our clients in achieving their financial aspirations.
Today, we operate as a partnership of 10 professionals, supported by approximately 30 staff members dedicated to assisting our Partners.
When you are looking for an accountant to look after your individual needs, we know that you want to talk to someone who you can trust to make the best choices for your situation.
Whether you are a busy person with uncomplicated tax affairs or someone who wants to benefit from the professional advice we are able to provide on complex matters, we will be there to help you out. We can reduce hassles, organise and plan your financial needs and build a long term, effective relationship with you - leaving you more time for the important things in life.
At GMG we think farmers are tops - we are inspired by the dedication and passion all of our farming clients have for what they do.
There is even the odd bit of envy from us - being cooped up inside all day sometimes makes us we wish we could spend the day outside too!
It takes a special kind of accounting professional to really help farmers out - and at GMG we keep well on top of developments, challenges and innovations across loads of farming sectors to ensure you will stay ahead. We implement a range of software solutions, and can do as little or as much of the administrative work for you so that you can have more time to spend doing what you love.
When you retire, you want to make sure you can get the most out of life and enjoy what you have worked so hard for. We want that too. With the superannuation sector growing rapidly, many people like to be able to have control over their future.
A self-managed superannuation fund administered by GMG allows you to be as hands on or off with your superannuation as you would like. We don't stop where most accountants do - we make sure you are ahead of the game by helping you access the best advice for your retirement goals. We have dedicated contacts who can help provide you with great advice on succession planning, property investment, stockbroking and much more.
Our team are always available to answer your questions and will help you stay on top of complex SMSF legislation. We use award winning superannuation software in Australia to minimise hassle and allow you to get information about your balance whenever you wish. We also have five registered SMSF auditors in our team and can provide reliable, objective services for your fund.

Empower people to improve their everyday lives through innovative healthcare solutions.
Country Care Group is a local family operated business that has been providing employment for locals for 13 years. Country Care was the first business of its type to open in Mildura. Both stores offer their local districts quality innovative products with a complete work shop service centre for backup support.
Our service technicians are available to come out to your home for repairs on many products - including scooters, power wheelchairs, lift chairs or electric beds (a standard call out fee applies). We strive to keep all parts prices and labour costs to a minimum. Our reseller network consists of privately owned and operated businesses where the owners usually work within the business providing you with the highest level of service possible. Between all businesses, there are over 80 showrooms and warehouses in various locations across Australia, and in excess of 300 delivery vehicles.
